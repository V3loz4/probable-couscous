# probable-couscous

This is my implementation of the CYK Algorithm, using 3 aproaches:
  - Naive
  - Bottom up
  - Top down

To work I have some implemented grammars, that are txt files existent in the src folder.

To run it it needs the user to go into the Main.java and change the pathfile for the txt file he/she wants to run in the program.

Currently this implementation is not working there is some sort of error with some arrays, but I haven't been able to solve this issue.

I will try and solve this issue, but for the time being there is an error.
